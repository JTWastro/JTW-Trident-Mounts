Standardised firmware for the JTW Trident GTR v2, for earlier models of the GTR or P75 mounts please email us first to check. 

To update the firmware use the uploaders, run the OnStepX uploader first and then the SWS one, following the on-screen instructions. To make your own build use the provided config.h files after renaming them and also copy the contents of the plugins directory to OnStepX/src/plugsins
