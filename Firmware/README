This folder contains tools to upload the firmware for Trident P75, GTR, GTS mounts with or without encoders as well as the Manticore when used with 3rd party mounts. If in doubt please contact us - info@jtwastronomy.com

**Before flashing the firmware**
1) Make a note of your settings in the 1st (Controller) tab of the Smart Web Server for the Ra and Dec axes, this is particularly important if you have encoders.
2) No other program should be connected to the controller via ASCOM/etc.
3) Be sure to observe the waiting period before restarting the controller using the power switch as per the on-screen instruction.
4) If you have encoders be sure to reset the origin before doing anything else. The mount must be at home, use the brakes to find the park position, engage the clutch and release the brakes. Press the encoder sync button directly under the servo monitor graph on the 1st tab (Controller) of the Smart Web Server and allow the controller to soft reboot.
5) Set your date/time/location again, use the set on connect option in the ASCOM driver (does not apply to controllers with the JTW Sensor Array).

**FAQ**
Q. The Smart Web Server uploader hangs while 'Looking for OnStep....' message is on screen.
A. The third button 'Confirm COM port selection and Upload the Firmware' is greyed out while the uploader is waiting for a response from the controller, once ready this button will become clickable and you can proceed.

Q. The controller won't connect once flashed, error message 'OnStep not found' when trying to connect by ASCOM. 
A. Flash the OnStepX firmware again, only the OnStepX firmware, not the Smart Web Server. 

Q. Do I need to factory reset the controller each time before flashing?
A. No, this is rarely needed, please contact us. 

Q. The firmware uploader completes very quickly, only 'Done' is reported in the white box of the uploader.
A. The uploader must be unzipped before running. 

Q. My computer blocks the uploader as a potentially unsafe program via a blue window with 'Windows protected your PC'. 
A. Click 'More info' and then 'Run anyway'.

**Manticore Controller** 
GTR Homing
This is for Trident GTR mounts with homing only

GTR 24b
Trident GTR with 24 bit absolute encoders and Trident P75 modified with 24 bit absolute encoders

GTR 26b
Trident GTR with 26 bit absolute encoders and Trident P75 modified with 26 bit absolute encoders

Trident 23b
Trident P75 modified with 23 bit encoders

Manticore Retrofit Controller
Manticore controller in all forms, including Trident P75 that have been upgraded to a Manticore. This firmware can be used to test a retrofit project prior to flashing with your own firmware, if needed. 

Factory Reset
This completely wipe the controller, including all settings. Please do not run these without contacting us first. Important: Allow 5 minutes after power cycling for the controller to fully erase itself, both the OnStepX MCU and Smart Webserver MCU must be flashed for a full erase.

**Smart Hand Controller**
Firmware for the wireless hand controller.
